With this map, organizations capture inefficiencies, pinpoint automation opportunities, and surface unseen compliance risks. ',

It blends the worlds of operations, compliance, and performance, bridging the gap between business analysts, compliance teams, IT operations, and frontline employees. The real power lies not just in finding which buttons are clicked, but in exposing the dependencies, exceptions, and bottlenecks that shape outcomes, either good or bad, across the business. '
